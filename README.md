# Website Blocker
A basic website blocker made using Python. 

This script modifies the hosts file on your computer to redirect specific websites to the localhost IP address, effectively blocking access to those websites.
You can add as many websites as you need. Additionally, note that this script may require administrative or superuser privileges to modify the hosts file, so run it accordingly.

Once the script is executed, the specified websites will be blocked on your computer. Any attempt to access those websites will be redirected to the localhost (127.0.0.1), effectively preventing access to them.To run this code locally:

`sudo git clone https://github.com/debjit-mandal/website-blocker`

`cd website-blocker`

`python main.py`


Please feel free to suggest any kind of improvement.
